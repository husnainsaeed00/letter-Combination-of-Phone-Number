# letter-Combination-of-Phone-Number
Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
This program solves the problem of generating all possible letter combinations of a phone number. Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, the program produces a list of all the combinations that the number could represent.

Example
Input:

makefile
Copy code
digits = "23"
Output:

["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]
Implementation Details
The program is implemented in Python and follows a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate the combinations. Here's how the program works:

A mapping of digits to letters is defined, resembling the telephone buttons.
The letterCombinations function takes the digits string as input and returns a list of all possible combinations.
Inside the letterCombinations function:
The base case checks if the digits string is empty. If so, an empty list is returned.
An empty list called combinations is initialized to store the final result.
The backtrack helper function is defined, taking the current combination, remaining digits, the digit-to-letter mapping, and the list of combinations as parameters.
Within the backtrack function:
The base case checks if there are no remaining digits. If so, the current combination is added to the combinations list, and the function returns.
The letters corresponding to the current digit are retrieved from the mapping.
Each letter is iterated over, and the backtrack function is recursively called, appending the current letter to the combination and moving to the next remaining digit.
The backtrack function is initially called with an empty initial combination and the digits string.
The combinations list is returned.
The program includes a sample execution in the main.py file, which uses the default input (digits = "23"). Feel free to modify the input in main.py to test different digit combinations.
Usage
To run the program on your local machine, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the program files.
Run the following command:

python main.py
The program will execute with the default input (digits = "23"). You can modify the input in the main.py file to test with different digit combinations.
The output will be displayed in the terminal.
Feel free to modify the program or integrate it into your own codebase as needed. Enjoy exploring the letter combinations!
